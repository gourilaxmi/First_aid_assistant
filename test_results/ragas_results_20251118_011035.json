      "answer": "WARNING: Immediate Action\nIf the nosebleed is severe, heavy, or accompanied by other symptoms such as difficulty breathing, CALL 911/999 IMMEDIATELY.\n\nStep-by-Step Instructions\n1. Sit up straight and lean forward to stop the bleeding, as recommended by WebMD (SOURCE 1). This will help prevent blood from flowing down the back of the throat.\n2. Use an ice cube wrapped in a cloth to constrict blood vessels, as suggested by WebMD (SOURCE 1). Apply the ice cube to the bridge of the nose or the nostrils.\n3. Pinch the nostrils shut with clean fingers for 10 minutes, as advised by WebMD (SOURCE 1). This will help apply pressure to the bleeding area and promote clotting.\n\nWhen to Seek Medical Help\n• If the bleeding does not stop after 10-15 minutes of applying pressure\n• If the bleeding is heavy or rapid\n• If you experience difficulty breathing or swallowing\n• If you have a fever or signs of infection\n\nWhat NOT to Do\n• Do not apply pressure with your bare hands, as stated by WebMD (SOURCE 1)\n• Avoid blowing your nose or rubbing it, as this can dislodge the clot and restart the bleeding\n• Do not take any medications, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, that can thin the blood and worsen the bleeding\n\nAdditional Notes\nIt's essential to remain calm and follow the steps above to stop the nosebleed. If you're unsure about the severity of the bleeding or have concerns, it's always best to consult a medical professional. The information provided is based on WebMD (SOURCE 1), which is a reliable medical source. However, it's worth noting that the other sources (SOURCE 2-6) do not provide relevant information on nosebleeds.

      "answer": "WARNING: Immediate Action\nIf you suspect someone is having a heart attack or cardiac arrest, CALL 911/999 IMMEDIATELY. These are life-threatening situations that require prompt medical attention.\n\nStep-by-Step Instructions\n1. Identify the symptoms: A heart attack typically presents with chest pain, pressure, or tightness that lasts longer than 3-5 minutes (SOURCE 1: Red Cross Manual, Page 55). Cardiac arrest, on the other hand, is characterized by a loss of consciousness and no breathing (SOURCE 3: Red Cross Manual, Page 75).\n2. Call emergency services: If you suspect a heart attack or cardiac arrest, call 911/999 immediately (SOURCE 1: Red Cross Manual, Page 55 and SOURCE 3: Red Cross Manual, Page 75).\n3. Provide basic life support: If the person is unresponsive, begin CPR if you are trained to do so (SOURCE 1: Red Cross Manual, Page 55 and SOURCE 3: Red Cross Manual, Page 75).\n4. Loosen tight clothing: Remove any constrictive clothing around the neck and chest to help improve breathing (SOURCE 1: Red Cross Manual, Page 55).\n\nWhen to Seek Medical Help\n• If chest pain worsens or does not improve with rest (SOURCE 1: Red Cross Manual, Page 55)\n• If the person loses consciousness or stops breathing (SOURCE 3: Red Cross Manual, Page 75)\n• If symptoms of cardiac arrest or heart attack occur, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or loss of consciousness\n\nWhat NOT to Do\n• Do not try to drive yourself to the hospital if you are experiencing symptoms of a heart attack (SOURCE 1: Red Cross Manual, Page 55)\n• Do not attempt to revive someone in cardiac arrest without proper training or equipment (SOURCE 3: Red Cross Manual, Page 75)\n• Do not use aspirin without consulting a doctor first if you suspect a heart attack (SOURCE 1: Red Cross Manual, Page 55)\n\nAdditional Notes\nIt is essential to understand the difference between a heart attack and cardiac arrest. A heart attack occurs when the blood flow to the heart is blocked, causing damage to the heart muscle. Cardiac arrest, on the other hand, is when the heart suddenly stops beating. Both conditions require immediate medical attention. If you are unsure what to do, it is always best to err on the side of caution and call emergency services.\n\nSources used:\n• SOURCE 1: Red Cross Manual, Page 55\n• SOURCE 3: Red Cross Manual, Page 75\n\nNote: The information provided is based on the sources cited and may not be exhaustive.

For partial airway obstruction, follow the steps below, but be prepared to call for emergency help if the situation worsens.\n\nStep-by-Step Instructions\n1. Check for airway and breathing: According to the American Heart Association (SOURCE 1), checking the airway and breathing is crucial in any injury or medical situation. For partial airway obstruction, try to keep the person calm and encourage them to stay upright to help keep the airway open.\n2. Clear the airway: If the person is having difficulty breathing due to an obstruction, try to clear the airway by gently tilting their head back and lifting their chin (SOURCE 3, Red Cross Manual, Page 181).\n3. Monitor for respiratory distress: Keep an eye on the person's breathing and watch for signs of respiratory distress, such as rapid breathing, harsh cough, or difficulty breathing (SOURCE 6, Red Cross Manual, Page 191).\n\nWhen to Seek Medical Help\n• If the person's symptoms worsen or they show signs of complete airway obstruction, such as inability to speak or breathe.\n• If the person experiences severe respiratory distress, such as coughing fits that last longer than 2 hours or difficulty breathing (SOURCE 6, Red Cross Manual, Page 191).\n• If the person has a history of severe allergies or anaphylaxis.\n\nWhat NOT to Do\n• Do not attempt to remove any object from the person's airway unless you are trained to do so (SOURCE 1, American Heart Association).\n• Do not inspect the mouth and/or throat of a person with croup or respiratory distress (SOURCE 6, Red Cross Manual, Page 191).\n\nAdditional Notes\nThe main difference between partial and complete airway obstruction is the severity of the blockage. Partial airway obstruction may cause difficulty breathing, while complete airway obstruction is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate attention. Unfortunately, the provided sources do not offer comprehensive information on the differences between partial and complete airway obstruction.
